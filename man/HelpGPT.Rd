\description{
Utilized OpenAIâ€™s API to translate .Rd documentation files into any language.
}
\details{
For \code{prompt=1}, the prompt is:

"Translate the following .Rd file text into formal, polished \if{html}{\out{<TargetLanguage>}}, making sure to maintain a professional tone. Do not add any comment. Ensure no changes are made to any \{ or \} characters, including preserving sequences of multiple \} (like \}\}). Do not alter any LaTeX commands or formatting commands (such as \verb{\\item{}{}}, \verb{\\code{}}, \verb{\\emph{}}, etc.). Each \verb{\\item} should retain its original structure and indentation, and nested items should remain within their original scope. Additionally, avoid translating any R code or variable names."

For \code{roll=1}, the system roll is:

"You are a helpful assistant familiar with R and Latex."
